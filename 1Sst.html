The Bauer Supreme 1S hockey stick is a mid kick point stick designed for fully loaded and 
powerful shots. 
<br> 
<br>
The transfer of energy from the handle to the blade is maximized using
Maximum Power Kick (MPK) Technology.  This ensures that during full motion shots, all the 
power that you put into the stick explodes through the puck. 
<br>
<br>
 The kick point of the stick
is higher up on the shaft than other sticks due to the reinforced taper that is coser to the 
blade.  This increases duability which allows for a more powerful flex for more powerful shots.
<br>
<br>
The stick's unique gold-weave TeXtreme carbon fiber is 20% lighter than other carbon fiber but 
with the same durability.  This results in a faster wind-up and a more explosive follow through 
for even harder shots.
<br>
<br>
Pucks, slashes, and skates cam all cause tiny cracks in your stick, but Bauer's eLASTech Technology
makes sure to stop the spread of these fractures, allowing your stick to perform to the best of its 
ability all the time.
